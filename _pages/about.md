I grew up in Shanghai, a famous historical and cultural city in the east of China. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree together with my Bachelor of Science in Physics degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in summer 2022 and my Master of Science in Health Data Science at Harvard University in summer 2024. I also took advanced computer science classes at MIT focusing on artificial intelligence and neural network architecture design. My undergraduate GPA was 3.99 and my graduate GPA is 4.00. I have been awarded a graduate with the highest distinction and graduation with the highest honor in computer science. So far, I have published papers related to high-performance computing, machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models. I am experienced in Java, Python, and SQL and I also took classes that use TypeScript, C, and C++ as primary languages. I am also good at building various neural networks using TensorFlow and Pytorch, implementing transformer-based models using Hugging Face, and engineering the prompt for large language models.

I worked as a Data Science intern for the Mayo Clinic, and a research trainee for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institution (DFCI), and the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). At Mayo, my job was to automate data abstraction for the generation of clinical registries using large language models and to build an automatic decision system to automate the approval of patient-requested Mayo appointments. At DFCI, my work was to implement large language models to identify performance status (PS) labels in unstructured clinical notes and correlate them with survivability analysis. At BWH, my project focuses on extracting patient entities from free-text EHR data using transformers and large language models (LLMs).

I currently work as a full-time research specialist in BWH, focuing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM).  Please see the "publications" and "projects" for past and current projects.

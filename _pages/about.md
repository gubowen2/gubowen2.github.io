I grew up in Shanghai, a famous historical and cultural city in the east of China. What impressed me most about my childhood perhaps was the bright sunshine as well as the atmosphere of equal rights my parents gave me in my growing up. While there are uncertainties in the future, I do feel a need to satisfy my endless impulsion to search, to explore, and to create.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree together with my Bachelor of Science in Astrophysics degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in summer 2022 and am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Health Data Science at Harvard University until my expected graduation on summer 2024. Besides Harvard, I am also taking advanced computer science classes at MIT. My GPA as an undergraduate student was 3.988 and I have been awarded a graduate with the highest distinction and graduation with the highest honor in computer science. My current GPA as a graduate student is 4.000. I have 1.5 years of Computer Science research experience together with 2 years of Astrophysics research experience. I also published 2 papers related to high-performance computing 1 thesis related to natural language processing and had 1 astrophysics paper manuscript. My latest research projects are related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am experienced in Java, Python, and SQL and I also took classes that use TypeScript, C, and C++ as programming languages. The Computer Science courses that I have taken so far include algorithms, data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, computer security, and distributed system. The Data Science courses that I have taken so far include programming in R, probability, statistical inference, statistical learning, and deep learning.

I currently work for the Mayo Clinic as an intern. My job duty is to build an NLP model that generates responses on behalf of the physicians that answers the frequently asked questions raised by the patients. The model will be implemented into clinical practice in the Department of ENT (ear-nose-throat) at Mayo. Besides, I work for the Dana Faber Cancer Institute as a graduate research assistant. My job duty is to build an NLP model that predicts the ECOG performance score of the patients using unstructured oncology notes.

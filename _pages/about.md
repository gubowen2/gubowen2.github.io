I have earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree together with my Bachelor of Science in Astrophysics degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in summer 2022 and will pursue my Master of Science in Health Data Science at Harvard University starting fall 2022. My GPA as an undergraduate student was 3.988 and I have been awarded a graduate with the highest distinction and graduation with the highest honor in computer science. I have 1.5 years of Computer Science research experience together with 2 years of Astrophysics research experience. I also published 2 papers related to high-performance computing and had 1 astrophysics paper manuscript. My latest research projects are related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am experienced in Java, Python, and SQL and I also took classes that use TypeScript, C, and C++ as programming languages. The Computer Science courses that I have taken so far include algorithms, data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, computer security, and distributed system.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

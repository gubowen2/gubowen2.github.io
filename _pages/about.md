I grew up in Shanghai, a famous historical and cultural city in the east of China. What impressed me most about my childhood perhaps was the bright sunshine as well as the atmosphere of equal rights my parents gave me in my growing up. While there are uncertainties in the future, I do feel a need to satisfy my endless impulsion to search, to explore, and to create.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree together with my Bachelor of Science in Physics degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in summer 2022 and am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Health Data Science at Harvard University until my expected graduation in summer 2024. I am also taking advanced computer science classes at MIT focusing on artificial intelligence and neural network architecture design. My undergraduate GPA was 3.99 and my current graduate GPA is 4.00. I have been awarded a graduate with the highest distinction and graduation with the highest honor in computer science. I have 1.5 years of Computer Science research experience together with 2 years of Astrophysics research experience. So far, I have published 2 papers related to high-performance computing, 1 thesis related to natural language processing, and 1 astrophysics paper manuscript. My latest research projects are related to intelligent healthcare system development and natural language processing. I am experienced in Java, Python, and SQL and I also took classes that use TypeScript, C, and C++ as primary languages. I am also good at building various neural networks using TensorFlow and Pytorch, implementing transformer-based models using Hugging Face, and engineering the prompt for large language models.

I currently work for the Mayo Clinic, Dana-Farber Cancer Institution (DFCI), and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). At Mayo, my job is to automate data abstraction for the generation of clinical registries using large language models and to build an automatic decision system to automate the approval of patient-requested Mayo appointments. At DFCI, my work is to implement large language models to identify performance status (PS) labels in unstructured clinical notes and correlate them with survivability analysis. At BWH, my project focuses on extracting patient entities from free-text EHR data using transformers and large language models.

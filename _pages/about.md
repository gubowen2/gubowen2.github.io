I grew up in Shanghai, a famous historical and cultural city in the east of China. What impressed me most about my childhood perhaps was the bright sunshine as well as the atmosphere of equal rights my parents gave me in my growing up. While there are uncertainties in the future, I do feel a need to satisfy my endless impulsion to search, to explore, and to create.

I have earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree together with my Bachelor of Science in Astrophysics degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in summer 2022 and is currently pursuing my Master of Science in Health Data Science at Harvard University starting fall 2022. Furthermore, I am taking Computer Science classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My GPA as an undergraduate student was 3.988 and I have been awarded a graduate with the highest distinction and graduation with the highest honor in computer science. I have 1.5 years of Computer Science research experience together with 2 years of Astrophysics research experience. I also published 2 papers related to high-performance computing and had 1 astrophysics paper manuscript. My latest research projects are related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am experienced in Java, Python, and SQL and I also took classes that use TypeScript, C, and C++ as programming languages (See the "cv" section for details). The Computer Science courses that I have taken so far include algorithms, data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, computer security, and distributed system (See the "course" section for details).

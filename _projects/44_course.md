Monitoring and evaluation is concerned with assessing the quality of a program as measured against action plans, and evaluating its overall impact. This course addresses the quantitative or statistical aspects of monitoring and evaluation: what to measure, how to measure, how to analyze and how to make inference for the next steps of program implementation. The course covers quantitative components of M&E, both current and innovative methods, and complements GHP 251 which describes the conceptual framework for M&E.

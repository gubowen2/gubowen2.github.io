This project aims at building an interpreter that improves Scheme's understandability to programmers who are used to more commonly used programming languages.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Built an extensible pretty-printer system using Scheme that takes a Scheme program's source code as input, and produces an equivalent in a syntax resembling another programming language. </li>
</ul>

The GitHub repository of this project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/gubowen2/pp-lang">here</a>, which includes the implementation of the pretty-printer system.

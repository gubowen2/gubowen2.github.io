This project aims at building an X-ray image classifier that helps classify pneumonia from the input chest X-ray images.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Used data augmentation to preprocess the data. </li>
<li> Used KNN, XGBoost, and CNN respectively to build three models. </li>
<li> Used cross-validation and grid search to find the optimal parameters for the model. </li>
</ul>

The Google Drive folder of this project can be found at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13sy---dttN-OvNVrz9JrqhZf3RBJl-sv">here</a>, which includes the implementation of the model, the project report, and the presentation slides.

The overall objective of this course is to allow students to integrate and apply various methods introduced in previous core coursework in the masterâ€™s in Health Data Science program to real-world data sets across knowledge domains, with a focus on building and implementing a data science solution. This is a predominantly project-based course with lectures focusing on project planning and execution, career development and special advanced topics in data science. Throughout the course, students will complete a data science project and develop a plan for how it will be used including considerations for user, data, modeling and implementation.

This course is an introduction to deep learning, a branch of machine learning concerned with the construction, development, and application of neural networks. Deep learning algorithms extract layered high-level representations of data in a way that maximizes performance on a given task. We will cover a range of topics including basic neural networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks, and applications to problem domains like computer vision and speech recognition. Programming (Python) and case studies will be used throughout the course to provide hands-on training in these concepts.

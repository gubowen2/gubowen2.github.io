This project aims at explaining the hyperfine structure of hydrogen in a detailed way after self-learning on this subject.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Introduced the cause of the hyperfine structure and compared it with the fine structure to explain further energy splitting. </li>
<li> Derived the Hamiltonian and illustrated the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen 1s state by establishing the hypothetical bases states. </li>
<li> Discussed two main applications of the hyperfine structure of hydrogen whose central mechanism is the transition between the two hyperfine energy levels of the hydrogen 1s state. </li>
<li> Discussed the limits of the hyperfine structure. </li>
<li> Introduced the changing of energy levels under external magnetic fields and transited the topic to the Zeeman effect. </li>
</ul>

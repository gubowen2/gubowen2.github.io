This project aims at comparing the performance of different estimators from a model generated in terms of a real-world problem.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Generated a model in terms of a real-world problem. </li>
<li> Established three estimators based on the model. </li>
<li> Simulated data based on the model and calculated the values of the estimators. </li>
<li> Compared the absolute mean bias, the mean variance, and the mean mean square error of the three estimators with respect to the sample size. </li>
</ul>

This project aims at identifing performance status (PS) labels in unstructured clinical notes using a text-based search, trained a CNN model and a transformer-based model to predict the ECOG PS, and evaluated the correlation between ECOG PS and survival outcomes.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Developed a model with 95.5% accuracy, and found strong correlation between ECOG PS and survival outcomes. </li>
<li> Worked with two medical oncologists and one data scientist at Dana-Farber. </li>
<li> Drafted a research paper. </li>
</ul>

This project aims at building an X-ray image classifier that helps classify pneumonia from the input chest X-ray images.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Used data augmentation to preprocess the data. </li>
<li> Used vision transformer to build the model. </li>
<li> Applied transfer learning using ResNet50 on the model. </li>
</ul>

The Google Drive folder of this project can be found at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ww91pW7KIGA-j11gf84qnt0Xoxq4hzUn">here</a>, which includes the implementation of the model.

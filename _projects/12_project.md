This project aims at engineering a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to extract information from unstructured clinical notes to automate the clinical registry generation process.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Formulated the LLM prompt, built an autograder to evaluate the pipeline performance. </li>
<li> Gave a presentation on the phased results on the Harvard DSI South Africa Training Program monthly seminar in collaboration with two data scientists at Mayo Clinic. </li>
</ul>

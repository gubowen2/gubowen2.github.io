In this paper, we developed a framework that addresses the limitation for the object-based concurrent assignments and completely automates testing by observing the events sent by the student-implemented observable objects. We developed a new testing-based framework to provide both a grading management and automation system for evaluating the concurrency requirements of assignments implemented in Java. We used the framework in an undergraduate course on object-based and concurrent programming, offered in the summer of 2021. We analyzed the performance of the framework based on studentsâ€™ scores on the assignment, the log recorded by the framework, and the office hour visits.

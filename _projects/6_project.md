This project aims at using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to color the HR diagram with rotation periods, H-alpha lines, and S indices of specific binaries to determine if M dwarfs with stronger magnetic fields tend to have different physical properties such as masses and radii than the inactive ones.

This project achieved the following:
<ul>
<li> Measured rotation periods and S indices of 143 binaries. </li>
<li> Fitted the position of the binaries using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) and got their complete orbital information (eg. masses, rotation periods, eccentricities). </li>
<li> Colored the HR diagram (mass VS absolute magnitude) using rotation periods, H-alpha lines, and S indices to indicate how strong the stars’ magnetic fields are. </li>
</ul>
